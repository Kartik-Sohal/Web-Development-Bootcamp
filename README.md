### About the Code

The code in this repository includes my solutions to the exercises and projects provided in the course. I have made an effort to keep the code as original as possible. While I do have access to solution files provided by the course, I will avoid including them here. Instead, I will use them sparingly for guidance and reference to ensure my work reflects my understanding and effort.

I will be updating this repository regularly as I progress through the course. New sections, exercises, and projects will be added over time. Stay tuned for updates!

### Disclaimer

This repository is meant for personal educational purposes. If you are taking the course yourself, I encourage you to try solving the exercises and projects on your own before referring to my solutions. This will help you get the most out of the course and enhance your learning experience.

Happy coding!
